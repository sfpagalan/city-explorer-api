# City Explorer API

**Author**: Sydney Pagalan
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Building custom API server that will provide data for the City Explorer app.

## Getting Started
Setting up React and API keys. Following Trello Todo to properly start and apply proper CSS later.

## Architecture
The application design involves using React as the frontend framework to create a user interface. It utilizes LocationIQ's API for location-based features, requiring an API key for authentication. The UI is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JSX, with Visual Studio Code as the development tool. GitHub is used for version control and collaboration, and Netlify handles deployment. JavaScript and JSX handle interactivity, while CSS ensures a pleasing design.
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
